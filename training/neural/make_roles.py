"""make_roles.py: rows for the neural reader's joint model (training/neural/finetune_roles.py): one request span -> its act, the value of
each legend question that has values (one class per value, or none), and a B / I / O role tag per word for the questions whose answer is
written in the request (names, a new name, a label text, a number).

Same data and the same split as make_data.py (its split_messages: the span-annotated messages minus the fixed 1000-message sample, 10% of
the messages held out by message id, seed 0; the sample and the docs/bench sets are exported as eval sets, never trained on).

The legend (docs/js/logic.js, read with node) decides how each gold key is learned:
  - action / ask                    -> the act (as make_data.py; the act set of docs/js/neural.js)
  - a key whose legend question has values (color, shape, size, position, style, arrow, pairing, ...) -> a class head over
    "none" + the values that key takes in the training gold. No word alignment is needed: the head reads the whole request.
  - a key without values (kinds names, name, text, number: target, anchor, from, to, linked, name, label, count, distance) -> B-key /
    I-key tags on the words of the request that carry the gold value, found by aligning the value to the words:
      * a name, a label text, a number written in digits: the same word sequence in the request, first free occurrence (find_part: the
        parts of a list in their order, the gold's case before any case; a text such as a label is one value even with a comma in it;
        the keys whose values are numbers are aligned last, so a number word never takes a name; a number with a unit glued on, "50px");
      * "$new" (a shape created earlier in the same message): the name that create gave it, when the request writes that name;
      * a number written as a word ("three"): learned by co-occurrence on the training rows (below);
      * a mention (mention(...)) or a name the request does not write ("it", "them"): not tagged; the filler-kind and description heads
        below read them.
Who fills each name-role (SOP-BERT reads it itself; owner, 2026-11-02: no reference may come from the rules' reading). For every key of
legend kind "names" (target, from, to, anchor, linked ...: REF keys), a class head "fill:<key>" over
  none        the request has no such role;
  written     every value is a name written in the request (or "$new" whose created name is written): the B / I / O tags give it;
  context     a value the request does not write: a pronoun or a vague reference ("it", "them", "the new one", "$new" with no name
              written, "the cities" for names created earlier). The value is taken AFTER reading by the context rule all readers share
              (docs/js/vss-composer.js nextContext: the last shape created or named), not by the model;
  description a mention(...) value ("the red square", "all circles", "the newest one", "every square that is not blue").
and, for the description, one class head "desc:<key>" per key the gold mentions use (quantifier, color, notColor, shape, recency, ... as
found in the training gold, mapped to the legend's key case-insensitively): "none" or a value. The description heads read the request once,
not per role: in the data no request has two described roles (counted below: "requests with 2+ described roles"), so one description per
request loses nothing; if one appears, the first described role in REF key order is the one the heads learn and the count says so.
The fill and desc heads are extra entries of reader.json "classes" (names "fill:<key>", "desc:<key>"), so the model, the export and
docs/js/neural.js makeReader decode them as any class head; reader.json "ref_keys" and "desc_keys" list them.
Counts (printed, saved in coverage.json "fillers"): per REF key and set, the fillers of each kind; requests with 2+ described / context roles;
context fillers that are a list ("them" -> several names: the shared context rule gives one shape, so these cannot come out right); and
the share of context fillers the shared rule gives right when every earlier request of the message is read right (an upper bound).
Co-occurrence alignment (training rows only): for key k, value v and a word w of the request, J(k,v,w) = n(k=v, w) / (n(k=v) + n(w) -
n(k=v, w)) over request spans (Jaccard). In a request with k=v, the word with the highest J is aligned when v is also that word's best
value of k (both directions agree); otherwise the value counts as not aligned. It is used for number words (the learned word -> number map
is saved with the model) and, as evidence only, for the class keys: how many of their gold values a single word of the request expresses.

Cutting (the model cuts the message itself): per message, a B / I / O tag per word of the WHOLE message (B first word of a gold span, I inside,
O outside every span) -> cut_train.jsonl, cut_heldout.jsonl, cut_eval_sample1000.jsonl (same split); finetune_roles.py trains a separate token head on them.
Spans of every annotated request count, also those whose act is not in the act set. Only with --none-rows (comparison, not the default):
No request (act "none"): the text outside every annotated span is learned as the act "none", with no class and no role labels. The pieces are
cut the way the reader sees them at use time: the rules' segmenter (docs/js/logic.js createSystem().formalize(text, ctx).segments, the
units docs/js/neural.js reads) is run on every message of the set (train, held-out, sample), and a segment that overlaps no gold span (no
word of it aligned to a word inside a span) is a "none" row. The segments the gold spans cover are not duplicated: the gold span is the row.
The bench sets (one request per text, no spans) have no "none" rows. The counts are printed and saved in coverage.json.

Words: the request split by WORD_RE (letters/digits runs, every other non-space character alone), the same split docs/js/neural.js
uses (WORD_RE there). Output (default ~/vss-box/ft/roles): train.jsonl, heldout.jsonl, eval_<set>.jsonl, reader.json (the head layout
the model folder's config.json carries: acts, tags, class keys and values, act_keys, number_words, word_re), coverage.json.

   Every list here (shape kinds, colours, sizes, line styles, arrow heads, positions, actions, questions, SOP Lang keys and values,
   capabilities) is read at run time from the engine's legend and plugins (docs/js/logic.js), so the reference cannot drift from what the
   engine does. The prose, the example sentences and the drawings around those lists are written here. A legend value without a
   description here is still listed (with its cue words), so a new action or value shows up even before anyone documents it.
   Every example sentence is meant to work with the Rules reader on the drawing the page opens with (Start, Process, Check, Done);
   an example with `pre` needs the sentences in `pre` first (they are shown next to it). A button with data-quick sends its sentence. */

    <li><b>Spelling.</b> A spell checker corrects near misses (“gree circle” → “green circle”). Your message shows what it changed. ${go('spelling', 'How it works')}</li>
    <li><b>Cutting.</b> The message is cut into requests: “draw a red circle named Hub” and “connect Start to it” are two. It is cut once, and all three readers read the same requests, so the tabs differ only in how each reader understands a request. The cut is chosen in ${icon('more')} Settings: the Rules segmenter, the VSS cutter or the BERT cutter${cut.current ? ` (now: ${escH(cut.current)}${cut.def && cut.def !== cut.current ? `; default: ${escH(cut.def)}` : ''})` : ''}. ${go('cutting', 'How the cut works')}</li>
    <li><b>Reading.</b> Each reader turns each request into one wire of SOP Lang.</li>
    <li><b>Doing.</b> The engine carries out the wires on that reader’s drawing. A wire it cannot carry out gets a reason (“There is already a shape named Hub”).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Nothing you type leaves your browser: all three readers run in this page. The drawings are not saved: reloading the page starts again from the example drawing.</p>

  <h2 id="replies">Reading the replies</h2>
  <p>Every reply has one line per reader:</p>

Connected Check → Gem.</div><div class="rl"><b>Neural · 140 ms:</b> Drew star1. Connected Check → star1.</div><div class="meta"><span class="lnk">details</span></div></div>
  <ul>
    <li><b>The time</b> is how long that reader took to turn your message into SOP Lang. Drawing is not counted. A reader that has not finished loading says so instead of answering.</li>
    <li><b>Different results</b>: here the Neural reader missed the name, so its star got an automatic name. Each reader changes only its own drawing.</li>
    <li><b>details</b> under a reply shows how the message was cut, what each reader wrote in SOP Lang, what the engine changed, and for questions the logic query it ran.</li>
    <li><b>Buttons under a reply</b> answer a question the reader asked, e.g. “Which circle? Start or Done”.</li>
    <li><b>“I didn’t understand …”</b> is an honest refusal: the reader found no request it could read in that part. It still does every other part of your message. Try plainer words, with shapes and arrows: “connect Plankton to Krill” instead of “plankton feeds the krill”.</li>
    <li><b>A reason instead of a result</b> (“There is already a shape named Hub”, “I can't find a red square”) comes from the engine: the request was understood but could not be done as asked.</li>

    <li>${icon('copy')} <b>Copy</b> appears when the drawings differ. It copies the drawing on screen, with its undo history, to the other tabs, so every reader starts the next message from the same drawing.</li>

    <li>${icon('more')} at the top: <b>Settings</b>: how messages are cut, the spell checker, the capability switches and the benchmark, which runs every reader on the same test sentences.</li>

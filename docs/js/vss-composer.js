// vss-composer.js: the VSS formalizer as a composition (research/hier/HIER.md section 3, the owner's architecture). One router, the cutter's.
// The registry (docs/model/micro/registry.json: [{world, events, model}]) lists the micro-worlds. The existing reasoning follows the
// reading of the chosen world: vss-adapter.js (readingFromWires, toNodes), with the references of the message (names created earlier,
// `last`) carried from unit to unit. Each unit's result carries its world id (unit.world, and node.world on every node it gave).
// Units that no candidate understands are "ignored" zones. No number in this file is tuned.
//
// The router (owner's decision 2026-11-01, training/sketch/ROUTER_V2.md; registry field "router": "cutter"; the earlier token router was removed):
//   1. the CUTTER WITH WORLDS (train_cutter.py --worlds: B-<world> labels; front.js segmentWorlds) cuts the message and ranks the worlds
//      of each unit by their B-<world> score at the unit's first token; no phrase -> action table runs before the router;
//   2. the candidates of a unit are the cutter's top ROUTER_K worlds (ROUTER_K = 3: the smallest k whose recall of the gold world is at
//      least 97% in cutter_worlds_probe.py, 97.9%). There is no fallback world (owner, 2026-11-02; SHORT2.md: the general model kinds_p80_s0 read
//      0 of 4643 requests on the 1000-message sample and 0 of 877 on the short sets; the branches that served it were removed, outputs identical);
//   3. each candidate reads the unit with ITS OWN front end; the reading that leaves the FEWEST WORDS NOT UNDERSTOOD wins (readWnu below, first
//      counted by the removed training/sketch/words_not_understood.mjs): the unit's surface words, punctuation excluded, that are not behind a role filler word, an
//      accepted offer or the action token of the reading; an unreadable status understands no word); a reading that understands no word is
//      not a reading (with no other, the unit is ignored: not understood);
//   4. a tie goes to the post-VSS layer (vss-context.js chooseReading: the reading the message context can complete; else the cutter's
//      order); the VSS layer never asks;
//   5. the post-VSS context filler (vss-context.js Context with docs/model/context/weights.json) fills the reference gaps of the chosen
//      reading; a request with a gap it cannot fill is asked (zone "ask"), not executed.
// EVENT HINT (training/sketch/EVENT_HINT.md; registry field "event_cutter", a path under docs/model/ like "cutter";
// absent = the composer above, unchanged):
//   1. the EVENT CUTTER (train_cutter.py --worlds worlds_micro/GROUPS_EVENTS.json: one world per legend event, labels B-<event>) is decoded
//      once over the whole message (front.js segDecodeLabels, the same tokens as segmentWorlds); a unit's EVENT HINT is the B-<event> label
//      with the largest score at the unit's first token (equal scores: label order). The event cutter does not cut; the units stay those
//      of the cutter with worlds;
//   2. each candidate world reads the unit as above; then, only when the hint is one of that world's events, the world reads the unit
//      again with the event given (vss.read opts.event, reader.js: the predicate's candidates are that event's verb lemmas and the verb
//      check is met) and that second reading replaces the first in step 3:
//      mode "H1" (registry field "event_hint", the default): when the first reading's status is unknown-event;
//      mode "H2": also when the first reading is readable (ok, abstain) and its event differs from the hint.
//   Each unit carries hint, hintApplies (the hint is an event of a candidate world), reread (readings replaced) and hintChanged (the unit's
//   chosen reading, world and SOP text, or ignored, differs from the one the first readings give).
// UNITS OF ANOTHER CUT (since 2026-11-03 afternoon the demo's VSS tab reads its own cut; VSS reads the BERT cutter's units for SOP-BERT's
// votes and VSS-BERT, see docs/js/ui.js crossReads and cutUnits below): formalize(text, ctx, {units: [{c0, c1}]}) reads those units instead of the cutter's. The world cutter is still decoded
// once over the whole message, only for the candidate worlds: a unit's candidates are ranked by the SUM of each world's B-<world> score at
// the cutter's own unit starts (segmentWorlds) that lie inside the unit, top ROUTER_K; a unit with no cutter start inside it ("no world
// signal") is read by EVERY world of the cutter (ranked by their B-<world> score at the unit's first token, which only orders ties) and the
// rule above (fewest words not understood) chooses. The event hint is read at the unit's first token. Everything else is unchanged. A unit
// that coincides with a cutter unit holds exactly one cutter start, so with the cutter's own units the output is the cutter path's output
// (checked by training/sketch/cut_bench.mjs, "identical").
// SIGNALS (training/sketch/VSS_CONFIDENCE.md, PRECISION.md; read by vss-confidence.js): every unit that gives a request carries
// unit.signals, the raw stage signals of the combined confidence, computed here from what the composer already has (no number tuned):
//   found 1; cut_start: at the unit's first token, the world cutter's best B-<world> score minus its best I/O score; cut_end: at the token
//   after the unit's last, max(best B, O) minus I (null when the unit ends the text); world_gap: the chosen world's cutter score minus the
//   best other candidate's (null with one candidate); world_rank: 1 when the chosen world is the cutter's first candidate; wnu_gap: words
//   not understood of the best other usable world minus the chosen one's (0 when no other world read it); tie: 1 / readings tied at the
//   fewest words not understood; notu_frac: the chosen reading's words not understood / its words; event_agree, event_gap: the event
//   cutter at the unit's first token (best B-<event> = the chosen event; its score minus the best other's); event_margin, role_min (min of
//   the role margins, null with none), margin_min (min of all margins, 0 with none), residual, unplaced (count), abstain (status not ok):
//   the reader's own numbers; ctx_fill (gaps the context filler filled), ctx_margin (the smallest finite margin of those fills, null with
//   none), ctx_left (descriptions left to the engine). These are exactly the `f` records of training/sketch/vss_confidence.mjs collect
//   (checked by training/sketch/test_vss_confidence.mjs). Every node a unit gives (its mentions and its request) carries the unit as a
//   non-enumerable property `unit` (node.unit.signals, node.unit.world), so a caller can gate a request by its unit's confidence.
